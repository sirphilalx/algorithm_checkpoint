# SENTENCE READER

Welcome to my algorithm checkpoint, and congratulations to me on making it this far.

## Checkpoint Objective ✴️

At this checkpoint, I was asked to write an algorithm that reads a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

    - The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
    - The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
    - The number of vowels in the sentence.

## Things I kept in mind 🧑🏻‍🏫

1. Each character was treated separately.
2. The last character is the point(.).
3. I used three variables as counters.
