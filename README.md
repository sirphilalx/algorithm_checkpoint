# SENTENCE READER

Welcome to my algorithm checkpoint, and congratulations to me on making it this far.

## Checkpoint Objective ‚ú¥Ô∏è

At this checkpoint, I was asked to write an algorithm that reads a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

    - The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
    - The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
    - The number of vowels in the sentence.

## Things I kept in mind üßëüèª‚Äçüè´

1. Each character was treated separately.
2. The last character is the point(.).
3. I used three variables as counters.

## Implementation

## Overview

This algorithm is designed to analyze a given sentence and provide counts for the number of words, characters, and vowels in that sentence. The algorithm assumes that words are separated by spaces and identifies vowels based on the English alphabet.

## Usage

1. **Input:**

   - Provide a sentence as input to the algorithm. The sentence should end with a period (`.`).

2. **Output:**
   - The algorithm will output the following information:
     - Word Count: Number of words in the sentence.
     - Character Count: Number of characters in the sentence.
     - Vowel Count: Number of vowels in the sentence.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
ALGORITHM sentence_reader
VAR
    sentence: STRING; // assuming the sentence is provided as input

    word_count: INTEGER := 0; // counts the number of words in a sentence
    char_count: INTEGER := 0; // counts the number of characters in the sentence
    vowel_count: INTEGER := 0; // counts the number of vowels

BEGIN
    // Read the sentence as input
    READ(sentence);

    // Iterate through each character in the sentence
    FOR i FROM 1 TO LENGTH(sentence) DO
        // Increment character count for each character
        char_count := char_count + 1;

        // Check if the character is a vowel (assuming English vowels)
        IF sentence[i] IN {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'} THEN
            vowel_count := vowel_count + 1;
        END_IF

        // Check for word boundaries (assuming words are separated by spaces)
        IF sentence[i] = ' ' THEN
            word_count := word_count + 1;
        END_IF
    END_FOR

    // Increment word count for the last word in the sentence
    word_count := word_count + 1;

    // Output the results
    WRITE("Word Count: ", word_count);
    WRITE("Character Count: ", char_count);
    WRITE("Vowel Count: ", vowel_count);
END
```
